# Managing Educational Content

You can view all the drafts and published items in the `Educational Content Management section.

`Draft` and `Publication` sections will expand by clicking on `Show All` to display all educational content cards in this category. Each Publication has a time estimation for it. 

## Reading Time Estimation

Reading estimation time varies for each type of publication. For PDFs, it is 30 seconds per page; for video, it is the video total time; for text-based publication, it is 30 seconds per page (before scrolling) OR 238 words per minute.
