The In-Lab Visit Log is an innovative feature aimed at improving the efficiency and accuracy of documenting participant interactions during in-lab studies. This documentation tool provides a robust platform to capture, manage, and review crucial visit data, facilitating a more streamlined research process.

## Key Functionalities

1. **Participant Visit Recording:** Log participant-specific details such as ID, visit start and end times, the overseeing researcher, and custom notes about the visit.
   
2. **Notes Area:** A dedicated space to jot down critical observations or incidents during the visit that could potentially impact data interpretation, thereby enhancing the validity of research findings.
   
3. **Document Uploads:** Facilitates the attachment of related documents (blood samples, ECG reports, pictures, etc.), linking critical physical evidence with the digital visit record.
   
4. **In-Lab Visit Table List:** A dynamic table displaying a snapshot of all visit records for quick reference, assisting in data management and review.
   
5. **Editable Records:** Empowers users with the ability to amend entries as needed, ensuring the information remains up-to-date and accurate.

The In-Lab Visit Log is intended to act as an essential research aid, providing a simple and effective solution to managing in-lab visit data. Its default settings have been configured to 'today's date' to align with common usage patterns and speed up the data entry process. It stands as a testament to our commitment to facilitating research processes through meaningful technology.
